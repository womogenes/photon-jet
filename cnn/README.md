# Hastily clobbered together CNN analysis

Trains and evaluates CNN on photon jet tasks. Bonus: uses the same random seed to split train/test data as the PFN, so results are directly comparable.

## Instructions

`cnn/data.py` exports some data that is used in the training and evaluation notebooks.

The real meat comes from the notebooks.
